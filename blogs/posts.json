    "body": "I kept forgetting who owed me what and how much I’d already been paid back, so I started scribbling notes and spreadsheets. That quickly got messy, and I wanted something I could open on my phone and update in seconds. I decided to build a small web app: a place to create “loans,” add amounts and labels, and see totals update automatically.\n\nI built it with PHP and a simple database so I could host it myself and keep full control of the data. I started with the basics: registration and login, a dashboard showing a grand total, and loan detail pages where entries can be marked as paid. From there, I added currency settings so it works across different countries, and a profile system where users can set a name and username.\n\nTo help new users get started quickly, I wrote a short user guide that explains how to register, track loans, and use the app’s main features.\n\nLoan Note is the app I use to stop losing track of who owes what—and the one I built step by step to solve that exact problem."
