    "body": "I kept forgetting who owed me what and how much I’d already been paid back, so I started scribbling notes and spreadsheets. That got messy, and I wanted something I could open on my phone and update quickly. I decided to build a small web app: a place to create “loans,” add amounts and labels, and see totals update automatically. I built it with PHP and a simple database so I could host it myself and keep control of the data. I added basics first: register and login, a dashboard with a grand total, and loan details with entries you can mark as paid. Then I added currency settings so it works for different countries, and a profile so people could set a name and username. I wanted to support the project without ads, so I added a “premium” idea: one-time contributions that unlock deleting loans and entries and changing your username more than once; I handle verification and proofs manually. I also needed a way for users to get help and for me to manage things, so I added a contact form, message threads with replies, and a red dot on the user icon when there’s a new reply. For myself, I built an admin area to handle pending payments, contact messages, and account reactivation or deletion requests. I tweaked the layout so the contact page and dashboard felt clean and worked on mobile, and I wrote a short user guide and deployment notes so others could run it too. Loan Note is the app I use to stop losing track of who owes what—and the one I built step by step to solve that problem."
